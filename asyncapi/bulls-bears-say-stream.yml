    WebSocket API providing real-time bull and bear case scenarios for securities.

    **Authentication**
    - Clients must provide their API token as a query parameter:
      ```
      wss://api.benzinga.com/api/v1/bulls_bears_say/stream?token=YOUR_API_TOKEN
      ```
    - Upon connect, you'll receive status messages for connection and authentication.

    **Filtering**
    - Filter by tickers: Use `tickers` query parameter (comma-separated)
    - Filter by ISINs: Use `isins` query parameter (comma-separated)

    **Actions**
    - `ping`: Keeps the WebSocket connection alive
    - `replay`: Replays up to the last 100 messages (cache-dependent)
