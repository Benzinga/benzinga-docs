## Core Infrastructure

### AWS Cloud Foundation

Our infrastructure runs entirely on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, taking advantage of:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Multi-AZ Deployment" icon="server">
    Services deployed across multiple Availability Zones for fault tolerance
  </Card>
  <Card title="AWS VPC" icon="shield">
    Isolated Virtual Private Cloud with strict security group policies
  </Card>
  <Card title="Route 53" icon="route">
    Global DNS with health checks and automatic failover routing
  </Card>
  <Card title="Managed EKS" icon="dharmachakra">
    AWS-managed Kubernetes control plane with 99.95% SLA
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Kubernetes Infrastructure

We operate **two dedicated Kubernetes clusters** to ensure safe deployments and environment isolation:

| Environment | Purpose | Deployment Flow |
|-------------|---------|-----------------|
| **Staging Cluster** | Developer testing, QA validation, integration testing | Code changes deployed first for validation |
| **Production Cluster** | Live customer traffic with SLA guarantees | Only verified releases are promoted |

#### Key Kubernetes Components

- **Karpenter** — AWS-native node autoscaler that provisions right-sized compute in seconds, not minutes
- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** — Automatic pod scaling based on CPU, memory, and custom metrics
- **Kong Gateway** — Enterprise API gateway handling ingress/egress, rate limiting, and authentication
- **ArgoCD** — GitOps-based deployment controller for declarative, auditable releases

---

## API Gateway & Traffic Management

### Kong Gateway

All API traffic flows through **Kong Gateway**, providing:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Authentication">
    API key validation and JWT token verification at the edge
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rate Limiting">
    Per-client request throttling to ensure fair resource allocation
  </Step>
  <Step title="Load Balancing">
    Intelligent traffic distribution across healthy service pods
  </Step>
  <Step title="SSL/TLS Termination">
    All traffic encrypted with TLS 1.3, certificates auto-renewed
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Route 53 DNS

AWS Route 53 provides:

- **Global latency-based routing** — Users automatically routed to the fastest endpoint
- **Health checks** — Continuous monitoring with automatic failover on failure
- **100% uptime SLA** — AWS-backed availability guarantee for DNS resolution

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

Our deployment pipeline enforces strict quality gates before any code reaches production.

### Development Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Developer Commit] --> B[GitLab CI Pipeline]
    B --> C{Linting & Tests}
    C -->|Pass| D[Build Container Image]
    C -->|Fail| E[Reject & Notify]
    D --> F[Push to Registry]
    F --> G[Peer Review Required]
    G -->|2 Approvals| H[Update GitOps Repo]
    H --> I[ArgoCD Sync]
    I --> J[Deploy to Staging]
    J -->|Validated| K[Promote to Production]
```

### Pipeline Stages

| Stage | Description | Quality Gate |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **Lint** | Code style and static analysis checks | Must pass all rules |
| **Unit Tests** | Automated test suite execution | 100% tests passing |
| **Security Scan** | Container vulnerability scanning | No critical/high CVEs |
| **Build** | Docker image creation tagged with commit SHA | Successful build |
| **Peer Review** | Manual code review by 2 developers | Dual approval required |
| **GitOps Update** | Image tag updated in ArgoCD repository | Manual promotion |

### GitOps with ArgoCD

All deployments are managed through **ArgoCD**, following GitOps principles:

- **Declarative** — Desired state defined in Git, single source of truth
- **Automated sync** — ArgoCD detects changes and applies them automatically
- **Rollback capability** — Instant rollback by reverting Git commits
- **Audit trail** — Complete deployment history via Git commit log

<Tip>
  Every production change is traceable to a specific Git commit, peer review, and approver — ensuring complete auditability for compliance requirements.
</Tip>

---

## Auto-Scaling Architecture

Our infrastructure scales automatically at multiple levels to handle traffic spikes.

### Pod-Level Scaling (HPA)

Each service deployment includes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler configuration:

```yaml
# Example HPA Configuration
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
spec:
  minReplicas: 3
  maxReplicas: 50
  metrics:
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: cpu
        target:
          type: Utilization
          averageUtilization: 70
```

**Scaling triggers:**
- CPU utilization > 70%
- Memory utilization > 80%
- Custom metrics (request queue depth, latency percentiles)

### Node-Level Scaling (Karpenter)

**Karpenter** handles cluster capacity by:

- Provisioning optimally-sized nodes in under 60 seconds
- Consolidating underutilized nodes to reduce costs
- Supporting spot instances for non-critical workloads
- Respecting pod topology and availability zone constraints

---

## Production-Grade Observability & Monitoring

Our infrastructure employs **enterprise-grade monitoring** with multiple layers of observability, ensuring complete visibility into system health, performance, and reliability. Every component is continuously monitored with automated alerting and incident response protocols.

### Alerting & Incidents

**Developer Assignment Process:**

1. **Alert Triggered** → Automatic Slack notification with context and metrics
2. **On-Call Engineer Triaged** → Severity assessed, incident channel created
3. **Developer Assigned** → Subject matter expert tagged based on affected service
4. **Investigation** → Root cause analysis using Coralogix traces and Datadog metrics
5. **Resolution** → Fix deployed through standard GitOps pipeline
6. **Post-Mortem** → Incident documented with preventive measures

<Warning>
  All P1/P2 incidents trigger **immediate automated paging** to on-call engineers with 24/5 coverage.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  Our monitoring systems have detected and resolved **95% of potential issues before customer impact** through proactive alerting and automated remediation.
