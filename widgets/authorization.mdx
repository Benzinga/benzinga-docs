## Overview

Benzinga Widgets require authorization to access premium features and real-time data. Authorization is handled through API tokens that are embedded in the widget URLs, ensuring secure access to financial data while maintaining seamless integration.

## Getting Your API Token

To use Benzinga Widgets with full functionality:

1. **Contact Benzinga**: Reach out to licensing@benzinga.com to obtain your widget API token
2. **License Agreement**: Complete the licensing process for widget access
3. **Receive Credentials**: You'll receive your unique API token for widget authorization

## Using Your Token

### Basic Authentication

Add your API token to the widget URL using the `token` parameter:

```html
<iframe
    frameBorder="0"
    height="600"
    width="100%"
    src="https://widgets.benzinga.com/embed/chart/AAPL?token=YOUR_API_TOKEN&timeframe=6m&exchange=NASDAQ"
></iframe>
```

### Best Practices

<Warning>
**Never expose your API token in client-side code that could be viewed by users.** Widgets are designed to be embedded on public websites, but you should implement server-side token management when possible.
</Warning>

**Recommended Approach:**
- Store tokens as environment variables on your server
- Generate widget URLs server-side with the token included
- Use URL signing or token rotation for enhanced security

## Token Management

### Security Considerations

- **Keep tokens private**: Don't commit tokens to version control
- **Monitor usage**: Track widget loads to detect unauthorized use
- **Rotate tokens**: Request new tokens periodically from Benzinga
- **Domain restrictions**: Configure allowed domains with Benzinga support

### Rate Limits

Widget API tokens are subject to rate limits based on your license agreement:
- Standard tier: Up to 10,000 widget loads per day
- Premium tier: Up to 100,000 widget loads per day
- Enterprise tier: Custom limits based on agreement

## Troubleshooting

### Common Authorization Issues

**Widget shows "Unauthorized" error:**
- Verify your token is correctly included in the URL
- Check that your token hasn't expired
- Ensure you're accessing from an authorized domain

**Data not updating:**
- Confirm your license includes real-time data access
- Check that your token has the necessary permissions
- Verify your rate limits haven't been exceeded

### Getting Help

For authorization issues or questions:
- Email: licensing@benzinga.com
