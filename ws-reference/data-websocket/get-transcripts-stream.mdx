- **Speaker Identification**: Track who is speaking (executives, analysts, etc.)
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor whether transcripts are in progress or complete
- **Flexible Subscription**: Subscribe to specific tickers or all transcripts with `*`
- **Mock Testing**: Test your integration with mock data when no live calls are active

### Use Cases

- Build real-time earnings call transcript viewers
- Create live captioning and accessibility tools
- Perform real-time sentiment analysis on earnings calls
- Extract key phrases and metrics as they're mentioned
- Alert on specific keywords or topics during live calls
- Archive complete transcripts with precise timing data

### Key Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `sentence` | The complete sentence text spoken |
| `sequence` | Order of this sentence in the transcript (0, 1, 2...) |
| `speaker` | Name/identifier of the person speaking |
| `status` | `IN_PROGRESS` (live) or `COMPLETE` (finished) |
| `confidence` | Overall accuracy confidence (0.0 - 1.0) |
| `words` | Array of individual words with timing and confidence |
| `start_time` / `end_time` | ISO 8601 timestamps for sentence timing |

### Transcript Status

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `IN_PROGRESS` | Transcript is currently live and receiving updates |
| `COMPLETE` | Transcript has finished, no more updates expected |

## Word-Level Data

Each sentence includes detailed word-level information:

```json
{
  "text": "Revenue",
  "confidence": 0.99,
  "start": 0,
  "end": 450
}
```

- **text**: The word itself
- **confidence**: Recognition confidence (0.0 - 1.0)
- **start/end**: Timing offsets in milliseconds from sentence start

## Interactive Commands

| Command | Parameters | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| `subscribe` | `ticker` | Subscribe to transcript updates for a ticker |
| `unsubscribe` | `ticker` | Stop receiving updates for a ticker |
| `list` | - | Get list of active/available transcripts |
| `subscribed` | - | Get list of your current subscriptions |
| `ping` | - | Keep connection alive (responds with `pong`) |
| `echo` | `message` | Echo test (responds with your message) |

## Best Practices

### Real-Time Display
- **Buffer Management**: Display sentences in sequence order using the `sequence` field
- **Speaker Formatting**: Format differently based on `speaker` (executives vs analysts)
- **Status Indicators**: Show visual indicators for `IN_PROGRESS` vs `COMPLETE` status

### Performance
- **Wildcard Caution**: Using `ticker: "*"` subscribes to ALL transcripts, which can be high volume
- **Targeted Subscriptions**: Subscribe only to tickers you need to reduce bandwidth
- **Heartbeat**: Send `ping` every 30-60 seconds to maintain connection

### Data Quality
- **Confidence Filtering**: Consider ignoring or flagging sentences with low confidence scores
- **Word Accuracy**: Use word-level confidence to identify uncertain transcriptions
- **Language Handling**: Check `language` field for proper text rendering

### Testing
- **Mock Mode**: Use `mock: true` for development when no live calls are active
- **Echo Testing**: Use `echo` action to verify connection and message handling
- **List Command**: Check `list` to see what's currently available

## Example Integration

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket(
  'wss://api.benzinga.com/api/v1/transcripts/stream?token=YOUR_TOKEN'
);

ws.onopen = () => {
  // Subscribe to Apple transcripts
  ws.send(JSON.stringify({
    action: 'subscribe',
    ticker: 'AAPL'
  }));
};

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);

  // Display the sentence with speaker
  console.log(`[${data.sequence}] ${data.speaker}: ${data.sentence}`);

  // Check if transcript is complete
  if (data.status === 'COMPLETE') {
    console.log('Transcript finished');
  }
};

// Keep connection alive
setInterval(() => {
  ws.send(JSON.stringify({ action: 'ping' }));
}, 30000);
```
