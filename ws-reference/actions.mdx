description: "Details about available actions for maintaining and replaying WebSocket sessions."
---

This page lists the supported actions you can use to interact with the Benzinga WebSocket API. These actions help maintain session health and access recent message history.

> **Note:** You cannot control the number of messages returned by the `list` action. The actual count depends on the number of messages currently cached for a given key.

## Available Actions

|  Action  | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `replay` | Replays up to the last 100 messages. The number of messages returned may vary depending on cache availability for the key. | `replay` |
| `ping`   | Keeps the WebSocket session alive by sending a heartbeat signal. | `ping` |

## Example Usage

**Send an action through your WebSocket client using the following format:**
Sample usage of ping:

```bash
ping
```

Response:
```bash
pong
```

Sample usage of replay:

```bash
replay
```

Response:
```json
{
  "id": "unique-uuid-for-response",
  "api_version": "websocket/v1",
  "kind": "stream_type",
  "data": {
    "action": "created/updated/deleted",
