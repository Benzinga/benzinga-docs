description: "Details about available actions for maintaining and replaying WebSocket sessions."
---

This page lists the supported actions you can use to interact with the Benzinga WebSocket API. These actions help maintain session health and access recent message history.


<Note>
You cannot control the number of messages returned by the `list` action. The actual count depends on the number of messages currently cached for a given key.
</Note>

## Available Actions

|  Action  | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `replay` | Replays up to the last 100 messages. The number of messages returned may vary depending on cache availability for the key. | `replay` |
| `ping`   | Keeps the WebSocket session alive by sending a heartbeat signal. | `ping` |

## Example Usage

**Send an action through your WebSocket client using the following format:**

```bash
