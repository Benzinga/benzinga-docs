## What Company Guidance Represents

Company guidance represents forward-looking financial expectations issued directly by a company's management. It typically includes projected ranges or estimates for key performance metrics such as earnings per share (EPS) and revenue for a specific fiscal period. Guidance reflects management's internal forecasts, assumptions, and strategic outlook at the time it is issued.

<Note>
Unlike historical financial results, guidance is prospective and subject to change based on market conditions, business performance, and external factors.

## Difference Between Guidance vs. Analyst Estimates

| Aspect | Company Guidance | Analyst Estimates |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Source** | Company management | Independent financial analysts |
| **Basis** | Internal forecasts and operational insight | External research models and assumptions |
| **Perspective** | Management's expected performance | Market consensus expectations |
| **Update Frequency** | Issued periodically or when outlook changes | Updated continuously |
| **Intent** | Communicate outlook and set expectations | Evaluate and forecast company performance |

---

## Why Guidance Matters for Forward-Looking Analysis

Guidance is a critical input for forward-looking analysis because it:

- **Anchors market expectations** to management's outlook
- **Signals confidence or caution** about future performance
- **Provides context** for interpreting earnings results
- **Helps assess directional changes** such as raised, lowered, or reaffirmed outlooks

<Tip>
Investors and analysts often compare guidance against prior guidance and analyst expectations to evaluate momentum, execution risk, and strategic direction.
</Tip>

## Data Source: Company Management Disclosures

Guidance data is sourced directly from official company communications, including:

- Earnings calls
- Earnings press releases
- Investor presentations
- Regulatory filings

<Note>
All guidance reflects information explicitly disclosed by company management and is structured to preserve the original ranges, estimates, and timing provided at the time of announcement.

## Guidance API – Developer Guide

### Overview

The Guidance API provides structured company-issued forward-looking guidance, including EPS and revenue projections. Guidance reflects management's expectations for a specific fiscal period and is critical for forward-looking analysis, comparison, and event-driven workflows.

## Guidance Metrics

### EPS Guidance

Each guidance record may include:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `eps_guidance_min` | Minimum EPS projection |
| `eps_guidance_max` | Maximum EPS projection |
| `eps_guidance_est` | Estimates midpoint EPS |
| `eps_type` | Accounting basis (GAAP or Adjusted) |

### Revenue Guidance

Each guidance record may include:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `revenue_guidance_min` | Minimum revenue projection |
| `revenue_guidance_max` | Maximum revenue projection |
| `revenue_guidance_est` | Estimates midpoint revenue |
| `revenue_type` | Accounting basis (GAAP or Adjusted) |

### Prior vs Current Guidance

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `eps_guidance_prior_min` | Prior minimum EPS projection |
| `eps_guidance_prior_max` | Prior maximum EPS projection |
| `revenue_guidance_prior_min` | Prior minimum revenue projection |
| `revenue_guidance_prior_max` | Prior maximum revenue projection |

<Tip>
Compare current guidance with prior projections to see if management has raised, lowered, or reaffirmed expectations.
</Tip>

## Timing and Period

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `period` | Fiscal scope (e.g., Q1, FY) |
| `period_year` | Fiscal year |
| `date` and `time` | Announcement date and time |
| `updated` | Last update timestamp (Unix UTC) |
| `prelim` | Preliminary indicator |

---

## Record Classification

### Primary Guidance

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `is_primary` | Y/N – Marks the default record when multiple guidance entries exist for the same company/date |

<Note>
Adjusted guidance is prioritized over GAAP for primary selection.
</Note>

### Confirmation Status

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `confirmed` | Y/N – Y indicates official company guidance; N indicates expected (unconfirmed) guidance |

**Confirmed guidance** (`Y`) represents official company disclosure.

**Unconfirmed guidance** (`N`) is automatically created for upcoming earnings, updated daily, and may include:
- Expected announcement timing
- Predicted metrics
- Primary/secondary classification

---

## Security Identification

Each record is associated with:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `ticker` | Stock symbol |
| `name` | Company name |
| `cusip` | CUSIP identifier |
| `exchange` | Exchange where the security trades |

This ensures accurate mapping of guidance to the correct company and security.

---

## Display & Interpretation Guidelines

- Use **primary guidance** (`is_primary = Y`) for default views
- Display full ranges when available; fallback to estimates when necessary
- **Confirmed guidance** represents official disclosure; **unconfirmed guidance** is indicative only
- Guidance should be interpreted alongside analyst estimates and historical performance

---

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| No data returned | Empty guidance array |
| Missing min/max values | Estimate-only guidance |
| Multiple records without a primary flag | Resolve using `is_primary` |
