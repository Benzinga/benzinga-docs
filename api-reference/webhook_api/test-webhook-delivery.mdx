title: "Test Webhook Delivery"
openapi: /openapi/webhook_api.spec.yml GET /api/v1/webhook/test
---

## Overview

Use this endpoint to trigger a test webhook delivery to your configured endpoint. This allows you to verify that your webhook integration is working correctly before receiving live production data.

## Testing Your Integration

When you call this endpoint, Benzinga will send a test webhook payload to your configured `destination` URL. This test delivery follows the same format and retry logic as production webhook deliveries.

### What to Expect

1. **Immediate Response**: The API returns a `200` status code if the test delivery was triggered successfully
2. **Test Payload**: Your webhook endpoint receives a test payload in the same format as production data
3. **Delivery Headers**: The test delivery includes the `X-BZ-Delivery` header just like production deliveries

### Verify Your Integration

Use this endpoint to confirm:

- Your webhook endpoint is publicly accessible
- Your endpoint can parse the webhook payload format correctly
- Your endpoint responds with appropriate status codes (2xx for success)
- Your endpoint responds within the 30-second timeout
- Your idempotency logic correctly handles the `X-BZ-Delivery` header and payload `id` field

## Best Practices

- Test with non-production webhook endpoints first
- Verify your endpoint responds with `200` or `204` status codes
- Confirm your logging and monitoring capture the test delivery
- Check that your deduplication logic works with the test delivery ID
- Test error scenarios by temporarily returning error status codes

## Troubleshooting

### 424 Delivery Error

If you receive a `424` status code, the system could not deliver the test payload to your destination endpoint. Common causes:

- Destination URL is not publicly accessible
- Destination endpoint is returning error status codes
- Network connectivity issues
- SSL/TLS certificate errors on the destination endpoint

### 400 Invalid Request

Verify that all required parameters are provided and correctly formatted:

- `destination` must be a valid HTTPS URL
- `version` must be `webhook/v1`
- `kind` must be `News/v1`
