description: "Push Benzinga market data to your systems with resilient, filterable webhooks."
---

Benzinga webhooks eliminate polling by posting real-time market events directly to your HTTP endpoint. Deliveries are JSON `POST` requests that include a unique `X-BZ-Delivery` header for deduplication and use a tiered retry strategy to maximize reliability.

## Available webhook services

- **Data Webhook Engine**: Real-time calendar and signal data (earnings, dividends, ratings, option activity, WIIMs, and more) with configurable filters and optional payload transformations. Read the full guide in [Data Webhook Engine](./webhook-engine).
- Additional webhook configurations can be scoped to your account. Contact your Benzinga representative to enable specific datasets or to register new webhook URLs.

## Integration flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Share your endpoint and filters">
    Provide a publicly reachable HTTPS endpoint plus any data type or geography filters you need. Benzinga will provision the webhook with those settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Handle deliveries idempotently">
    Parse the JSON payload, use the `id` and `X-BZ-Delivery` values to avoid duplicates, and respond quickly with a 2xx status to acknowledge receipt.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor and iterate">
    Track failures, timeouts, and retries in your logs. Adjust filters or payload transformations with your Benzinga contact if your downstream systems have new requirements.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best practices

- Use HTTPS and authentication on your webhook endpoint.
- Process work asynchronously so responses return within 30 seconds.
- Store processed delivery IDs to ensure idempotency across retries.
- Test against non-production endpoints before switching to live delivery.
